# This is a playbook for setting up a container security testing workstation with GUI tools which
# can be used if you have an X server on the host you're connecting from (e.g. xMing or Mobaxterm on windows)
# if you don't need/want specific tools just comment out the appropriate line.
# N.B. change the user: variable to whatever user you use.
